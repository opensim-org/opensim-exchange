# opensim-exchange
Repository to contain files/utilities contributed by the user community to help each other

The top level breaks down by language/platform since contributors likely have a specific platform in mind, then by functionality and then by contributor/lab, for example:
python/data_processing/nmbl_lab/utility1.py

Every folder should have a readme file describing functionality (if documented elsewhere include a link), supported versions(e.g. OpenSim 4.4, Python 3.8)
